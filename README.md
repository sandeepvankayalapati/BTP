Comparision of Usability Metrics: A case study on IRCTC.
The goal of the experiment is to design a prototype of the IRCTC application which resolves a majority of the issues which the users stated through the online and
offline surveys and also improve the usability of the application.The motivation for this study is derived from the recent paper by Ferreira (2022), which emphasizes the importance of usability mechanisms in enhancing the user experience of e-commerce websites. In his study, Ferreira conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the usability of several e-commerce websites and analyzed the results using different metrics. The usability mechanisms assessed by Ferreira included ease of navigation, clarity of information, and the efficiency of checkout processes. The evaluation of these mechanisms will be based on several usability metrics,including efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Specifically, efficiency will be measured regarding the time taken to complete tasks, effectiveness will be evaluated based on the success rate of completing tasks, and user satisfaction will be assessed through surveys and user feedback. The findings of this study
will provide insights into how usability mechanisms can be leveraged to improve the overall user experience of the IRCTC application, which can increase customer satisfaction and usage of the platform. Overall, this research aims to contribute to the broader understanding of how usability mechanisms can be utilized to enhance the design of e-commerce websites, specifically in the context of the IRCTC platform.
